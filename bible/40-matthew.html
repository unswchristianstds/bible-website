			<h4 id="matthew-1">Matthew 1</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Judah begot Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Aram,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Aram begot Aminadab, and Aminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Salmon begot Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed of Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jesse begot David the king.        And David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Asa begot Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Uzziah begot Jotham, and Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And after the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel, and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Zerubbabel begot Abiud, and Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Azor begot Zadok, and Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Thus all the generations from Abraham until David are fourteen generations, and from David until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, fourteen generations.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Joseph her husband, being righteous and not willing to disgrace her openly, intended to send her away secretly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Now all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> “Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel” (which is translated, God with us).<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to himself his wife.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And he did not know her until she bore a son. And he called His name Jesus.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-2">Matthew 2</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star at its rising and have come to worship Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written through the prophet:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> “And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means are you the least among the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a Ruler, One who will shepherd My people Israel.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then Herod, secretly calling the magi, determined accurately from them the time that the star appeared.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find Him, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And after they heard the king, they went their way, and behold, the star which they saw at its rising led them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they came into the house and saw the child with Mary His mother. And falling down, they worshipped Him; and opening their treasures, they offered gifts to Him, gold and frankincense and myrrh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And because they had been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed by another way to their country.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And he arose and took the child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, became greatly enraged, and sending out men, he did away with all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all its borders from two years old and under, according to the time that he had accurately determined from the magi.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> “A voice in Ramah was heard, weeping and great lamentation: Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because they are no more.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those who seek the life of the child have died.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he arose and took the child and His mother and entered into the land of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But because he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he departed into the regions of Galilee.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And he came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-3">Matthew 3</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Now this John had his garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Produce then fruit worthy of your repentance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children to Abraham.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And already the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Whose winnowing fan is in His hand. And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permitted Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.<br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="matthew-4">Matthew 4</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He became hungry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But He answered and said, It is written, “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Then the devil took Him into the holy city and set Him on the wing of the temple,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, “To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Jesus said to him, Again, it is written, “You shall not test the Lord your God.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it is written, “You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is beside the sea in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And while He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And immediately leaving the nets, they followed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the report concerning Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those afflicted with various diseases and torments and those possessed by demons and epileptics and paralytics; and He healed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And great crowds followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.<br><br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="matthew-5">Matthew 5</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when He saw the crowds, He went up to the mountain. And after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And opening His mouth, He taught them, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> You have heard that it was said to the ancients, “You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> So if your right eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And if your right hand stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to pass away into Gehenna.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, “You shall not break an oath, but you shall render to the Lord your oaths.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> Nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> You have heard that it was said, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> But I tell you not to resist him who is evil; rather whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> You have heard that it was said, “You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> So that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.<br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="matthew-6">Matthew 6</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Therefore when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But you, when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> So that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And in praying do not babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows the things that you have need of before you ask Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> You then pray in this way: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Give us today our daily bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when you fast, do not be like the sullen-faced hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> So that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not dig through nor steal.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Because of this, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Look at the birds of heaven. They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are you not of more value than they?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And why are you anxious concerning clothing? Consider well the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin thread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And if God so arrays the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, you of little faith?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?<br><br>

				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks him for a loaf, will give him a stone?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Or also when he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Therefore all that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> By their fruits you will recognize them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Even so every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they dashed against that house; and it fell, and its fall was great.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astounded at His teaching,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> For He taught them as One having authority and not like their scribes.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when He entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, beseeching Him<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And saying, Lord, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, terribly tormented.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And He said to him, I will come and heal him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, With no one in Israel have I found such great faith.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> But I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jesus said to the centurion, Go; as you have believed, so be it done to you. And his servant was healed in that hour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Jesus, coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when evening fell, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all those who were ill He healed,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> So that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And a scribe came near and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when He stepped into the boat, His disciples followed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was sleeping.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they came near and roused Him, saying, Lord, save us; we are perishing!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And He said to them, Why are you cowardly, you of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And when He came to the other side, into the region of the Gadarenes, two possessed by demons met Him, as they were coming out of the tombs, so exceedingly fierce that no one was able to pass by on that road.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And behold, they cried out, saying, What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here before the time to torment us?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Now there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many hogs feeding.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the demons entreated Him, saying, If You cast us out, send us into the herd of hogs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And He said to them, Go! And they came out and went into the hogs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And those who were feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to those possessed by demons.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated Him to depart from their borders.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And stepping into a boat, He crossed over and came to His own city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins — then He said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and go to your house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And he rose and went away to his house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when the crowds saw this, they feared and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax office, called Matthew, and He said to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And as He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But go and learn what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> As He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Jesus rose and followed him, and so did His disciples.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For she said within herself, If only I touch His garment, I will be healed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when Jesus came to the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> He said, Depart, for the girl has not died but is sleeping. And they laughed scornfully at Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But when the crowd had been put out, He entered and took hold of her hand, and the girl rose up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And this report went out into all that land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, Son of David!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And when He came into the house, the blind men came to Him; and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, let it be done to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them saying, See that no one knows!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> But they went out and spread reports about Him in all that land.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man possessed with a demon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-10">Matthew 10</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> These twelve Jesus sent forth, charging them, saying, Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Do not acquire for yourselves gold nor silver nor copper for your belts;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> No bag for the journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and there remain until you depart.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And as you enter into the house, greet it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And beware of men, for they will deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you will also be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And you will be hated by all because of My name. But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when they persecute you in this city, flee into another. For truly I say to you, You shall by no means finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be made known.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Everyone therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> But whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> For I have come to set men at variance: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And a man’s enemies will be those of his household.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward, and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And whoever gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-11">Matthew 11</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> The blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And as these went away, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> This is he concerning whom it is written, “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Truly I say to you, Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> He who has ears to hear, let him hear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to the others<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down. For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until today.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.<br><br>

			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields. And His disciples became hungry and began to pick ears of grain and eat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> How he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But if you knew what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” you would not have condemned the guiltless.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And departing from there, He came into their synagogue.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He said to them, What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out and it was restored, as sound as the other.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He charged them not to make Him known,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> “Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And in His name will the Gentiles hope.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And all the crowds were amazed and said, Is this not the Son of David?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will thoroughly plunder his house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came out. And it comes and finds it unoccupied, swept, and decorated.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be also with this evil generation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside seeking to speak to Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And someone said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> But He answered and said to him who spoke to Him, Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-13">Matthew 13</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And others fell on the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But others fell on the good earth and yielded fruit, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> He who has ears to hear, let him hear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, “In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> You therefore hear the parable of the one who sowed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is the one sown beside the way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the one sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Yet he does not have root in himself but lasts only for a time, and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately he is stumbled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the one sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> So that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> Which, when it was filled, they brought onto the shore, and sat down and collected the good into vessels; but the foul they cast out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> So it will be at the consummation of the age: the angels will go forth and separate the evil from the midst of the righteous,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> And He said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> And He came into His own country and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> And they were stumbled because of Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>58</b></sup> And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-14">Matthew 14</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For John had been saying to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And though he desired to kill him, he feared the crowd because they held him as a prophet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in their midst and pleased Herod;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Hence, he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And she, being instigated by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the king was grieved, yet because of the oaths and those reclining at table with him, he commanded it to be given.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And he sent men and beheaded John in the prison.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And his disciples came and took the corpse and buried it; and they came and reported the matter to Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And when Jesus heard this, He withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place privately. And when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And going forth, He saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Now when evening fell, the disciples came to Him, saying, This place is deserted and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And they said to Him, We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And He said, Bring them here to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve handbaskets full.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And those who ate were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And immediately He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And after He sent the crowds away, He went up to the mountain privately to pray. And when night fell, He was there alone.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Now the boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And the disciples, seeing Him walking on the sea, were startled, saying, It is a ghost! And they cried out for fear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> But immediately Jesus talked to them, saying, Take courage. It is I. Do not be afraid.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And He said, Come. And Peter, coming down from the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> But seeing the strong wind, he became frightened; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And when they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were ill.<br><br> 
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched were completely healed.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-15">Matthew 15</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> For God said, “Honor your father and your mother,” and, “He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But you say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now a gift to God,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Hypocrites! Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He called the crowd to Him and said to them, Hear and understand:<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Let them be. They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He said, Are you also still without understanding?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the drain?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jesus departed from there and came beside the Sea of Galilee; and He went up to the mountain and sat there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the dumb, and many other sick ones; and they laid them at His feet, and He healed them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> So that the crowd marveled, because they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled healthy and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And the disciples said to Him, Where can we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And after He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> He took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And those who ate were four thousand men, apart from women and children.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And after He sent the crowds away, He stepped into the boat and came to the borders of Magadan.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-16">Matthew 16</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> But He answered and said to them, When evening falls, you say, There will be fair weather, for the sky is red;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and gloomy. The face of the sky you know how to discern, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah. And He left them and went away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And when the disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> But they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we did not take bread.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Jesus, knowing it, said, Why are you reasoning among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have no bread?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Do you not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many handbaskets you took up?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> How is it that you do not understand that it was not about bread that I spoke to you? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.<br><br>

				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He answered and said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then the disciples, coming to Jesus privately, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And He said to them, Because of your little faith; for truly I say to you, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they were greatly grieved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-18">Matthew 18</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-19">Matthew 19</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And said, “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh”?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> So then they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> They said to Him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who can accept it, let him accept it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And after He laid His hands on them, He went on from there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> He said to Him, Which ones? And Jesus said, “You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Honor your father and mother; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be saved?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You. What then will there be for us?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name’s sake shall receive a hundred times as much and shall inherit eternal life.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> But many first will be last, and many last first.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-20">Matthew 20</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And to those he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And when the first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they themselves also received each a denarius.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one even as I have given to you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Thus shall the last be first and the first last.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to death,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> But Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be silent, but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Jesus, standing still, called them and said, What do you want Me to do for you?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him.<br><br>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="matthew-21">Matthew 21</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and lead them to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and immediately he will send them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Now this took place in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> “Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the disciples went and did as Jesus directed them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And led the donkey and the colt. And they put their garments on them, and He sat upon them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And when He entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the crowds said, This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple. And He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling the doves,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He said to them, It is written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer,” but you are making it a den of robbers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they said to Him, Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, “Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise”?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Now in the morning as He returned to the city, He became hungry.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And seeing a fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, May there no longer be fruit from you forever! And the fig tree was instantly dried up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when the disciples saw this, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And all that you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and said, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> The baptism of John, from where did it come, from heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. He too said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> But what do you think? A man had two children. And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And he came to the other and said likewise. And he answered and said, I will, sir; yet he did not go.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Which of the two did the will of the father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Hear another parable. There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And the vinedressers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Again, he sent some other slaves, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Then later he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> They said to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, “The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes”?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking concerning them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And though they sought to seize Him, they feared the crowds because they held Him as a prophet.<br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="bible-text">
			<h4 id="matthew-22">Matthew 22</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And he sent his slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast, yet they would not come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Again, he sent other slaves, saying, Tell those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But they disregarded it and went off, one to his own field and another to his business,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the rest took hold of his slaves, treated them shamefully, and killed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the king became angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Then he said to his slaves, The wedding feast is ready, but those who have been called were not worthy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Go therefore to the crossroads, and as many as you find, call to the wedding feast.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding feast was filled with those reclining at table.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For many are called but few are chosen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true and that You teach the way of God in truth and do not fear anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Tell us therefore, What do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Show Me the coin for the tribute. And they brought to Him a denarius.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> They said, Caesar’s. Then He said to them, Render then the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar and the things that are God’s to God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And when they heard this, they marveled. And they left Him and went away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And last of all the woman died.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> But the Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And He said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> This is the great and first commandment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And the second is like it: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David’s.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet”?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-23">Matthew 23</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in Moses’ seat;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And all their works they do to be seen by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes of their garments,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And they love the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the salutations in the marketplaces and to be called by men, Rabbi.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the greatest among you shall be your servant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close off the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the widows’ houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers. For this reason you shall receive greater judgment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Fools and blind men, which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift which is upon it, he is bound.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Blind men, which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifies the gift?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all the things upon it;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law — justice and mercy and faithfulness. But these you should have done and not neglected the others.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inwardly they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the dish so that their outside also may become clean.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> So then you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of Gehenna?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Truly I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> Behold, your house is left to you desolate.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-24">Matthew 24</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> All these things are the beginning of birth pangs.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And at that time many will be stumbled and will deliver up one another and will hate one another.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And because lawlessness will be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the Holy Place (let him who reads understand),<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take the things out of his house;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, those days will be cut short.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Behold, I have told you beforehand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> For just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures be gathered together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> But learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> For just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> But know this, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> But if that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-25">Matthew 25</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And five of them were foolish and five were prudent.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained another five.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master’s money.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he who had received the two talents also came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And his master answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And He will set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> For I was hungry and you did not give Me anything to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a drink;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither have you done it to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-26">Matthew 26</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when Jesus finished all these words, He said to His disciples,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is being delivered up to be crucified.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they took counsel together to seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> But Jesus, knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done it for My burial.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> At that time one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And from then on he sought opportunity to deliver Him up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the passover?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near. I am keeping the passover at your house with My disciples.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the passover.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when evening fell, He reclined at table with the twelve.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And as they were eating, He said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And being greatly grieved, each one of them began to say to Him, I am not the one, am I, Lord?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And He answered and said, The one who dips his hand with Me in the dish, this one will betray Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> The Son of Man is going away, even as it is written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, I am not the one, am I, Rabbi? He said to him, You have said it yourself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> But I say to you, I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Then Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, “I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Then Peter answered and said to Him, If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> Peter said to Him, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You. And all the disciples said likewise.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go over there and pray.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee aside, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> Then He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And going forward a little, He fell on His face and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> Again, going away a second time, He prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And leaving them, He went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same word again.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Then He came to the disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one who is betraying Me has drawn near.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> And immediately he came to Jesus and said, Rejoice, Rabbi, and kissed Him affectionately.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, Friend, what are you here for? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> Or do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen this way?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> But all this has happened in order that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left Him and fled.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> And those who seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>58</b></sup> And Peter followed Him at a distance to the courtyard of the high priest; and entering within, he sat with the attendants to see the end.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>59</b></sup> Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put Him to death,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>60</b></sup> And they did not find it, though many false witnesses came forward. But later two came<br><br>
				 <sup><b>61</b></sup> And said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it up in three days.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>62</b></sup> And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it that these testify against You?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>63</b></sup> But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>64</b></sup> Jesus said to him, You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>65</b></sup> Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>66</b></sup> What do you think? And they answered and said, He is worthy of death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>67</b></sup> Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>68</b></sup> Saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who hit You?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>69</b></sup> Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>70</b></sup> But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>71</b></sup> And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>72</b></sup> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>73</b></sup> And after a little while those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>74</b></sup> Then he began to curse and to swear: I do not know the man! And immediately a rooster crowed.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>75</b></sup> And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-27">Matthew 27</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that yourself!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and hanged himself.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And after taking counsel, they bought with it the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that had been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel had priced,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> And they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said, It is as you say.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And He did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And they had at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> For he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said, Barabbas.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Let Him be crucified!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But he said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an uproar was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man’s blood. You see to it yourselves.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And all the people answered and said, His blood be upon us and upon our children!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered about Him the whole cohort.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> And they wove a crown of thorns and placed it on His head and put a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him, saying, Rejoice, King of the Jews!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And they spat on Him and took the reed and beat Him on the head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this one they compelled to take up His cross.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>35</b></sup> And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>36</b></sup> And they sat down and guarded Him there.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>37</b></sup> And they set in writing over His head the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>38</b></sup> At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>39</b></sup> And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads<br><br>
				 <sup><b>40</b></sup> And saying, You who destroy the temple and build it up in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>41</b></sup> Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked Him and said,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>42</b></sup> He saved others; Himself He cannot save. He is King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>43</b></sup> He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him, for He said, I am the Son of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>44</b></sup> And in the same way the robbers who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>45</b></sup> Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>46</b></sup> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>47</b></sup> And some of those standing there, when they heard this, said, This man is calling Elijah.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>48</b></sup> And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>49</b></sup> But the rest said, Let Him be. Let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>50</b></sup> And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up His spirit.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>51</b></sup> And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were split,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>52</b></sup> And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>53</b></sup> And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection and entered into the holy city and appeared to many.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>54</b></sup> Now the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, became greatly frightened, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>55</b></sup> And many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>56</b></sup> Among whom were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>57</b></sup> And when evening fell, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>58</b></sup> This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>59</b></sup> And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean, fine linen cloth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>60</b></sup> And he laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. And having rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, he went away.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>61</b></sup> And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>62</b></sup> On the next day, which is the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered unto Pilate,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>63</b></sup> Saying, Sir, we have remembered that while He was still living, that deceiver said, After three days I will arise.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>64</b></sup> Therefore, give orders for the grave to be secured until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away and say to the people, He has been raised from the dead. And the last deception will be worse than the first.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>65</b></sup> Pilate said to them, Take a guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>66</b></sup> And they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard being there.<br><br>

			<h4 id="matthew-28">Matthew 28</h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> And his appearance was like lightning, and his garment as white as snow.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And for fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> He is not here, for He has been raised, even as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has been raised from the dead, and behold, He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And they went away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to report this to His disciples.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> And behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice! And they came to Him and took hold of His feet and worshipped Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go and report to My brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And as they were going, behold, some from the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> And after the chief priests had gathered with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Saying, Say this, His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make sure that you have nothing to worry about.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been widely spread among the Jews until this very day.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus directed them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, though some doubted.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.<br><br>
